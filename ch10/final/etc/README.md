# CS110 Final Exam

## SHORT DESCRIPTION *(1 or 2 sentences describing your program)*
    - this program uses a image creator API , joke generator API, and a IP API.
    - using these three APIs it creates jokes with various backgrounds as well as motivational quotes.
## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS *(list any known bugs or non-working parts)*
- The cropping for the pygame display is a little janky:
    - I could not come up with anything besides display.blit() for the image to show and had to set the placement at (0,0)
## REFERENCES *(any resources you use outside of class materials)*
- besides the API list provided i had looked up background pictures for the jokes and motiviational text to show up on 
## MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS *(anything else you would like the grader to know)*
 - the motivational part is just supposed to be funny, it made me laugh thinking of designing it this way, it's a feature not a bug lol
