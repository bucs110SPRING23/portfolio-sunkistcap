# CS110 Midterm Exam
## SHORT DESCRIPTION 
*I wanted to do something a little goofy so I decided to go with 'Among us'. I only had to draw one character and the others were simply reusing that code with different colors, besides the logo. I think I put a nice twist to the drawing, run it more then once ^-^*
## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS 
*None*
## REFERENCES 
*The hit game 'Among us', I can't really link pictures but pictures of the imposters and cover art was used for reference*
## MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS
*It will take a little to get to the drawing because of the stars, I'm sorry! To see the surpise, if you wanna save time you can # the star function out of main and use ''' at the top and bottom of the stars funtion*
