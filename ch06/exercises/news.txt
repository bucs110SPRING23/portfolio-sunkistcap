A natural disaster is a major event resulting from natural processes of the Earth. It causes a great loss of life and property. During such disasters, the number of people who are rendered, trippled and houseless is more than the number of people who loose their lives. Even the economy of the peace which faces a natural disaster, gets effected.
It is true that a natural disaster is a natural process and we cannot stop it but by making certain preparations, we can reduce the magnitude of the loss to life and property. First of all we should reduce global warming which is the root cause of all the problems. We should also have insurance policies so that we could have sufficient money to rebuilt our lives after any such disaster. 
The scientists should invent advance warming systems. While construction we should make sure that it is strong enough to withstand earthquakes. We should educate people about evacuation during any disaster. Hence, by taking some precautions we can cape with the natural disasters.
